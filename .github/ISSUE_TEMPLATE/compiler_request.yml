        Note: You are welcome to open a request for a compiler - but you're even more welcome to open a PR for it! Today we rely almost entirely on contributions for compiler/library requests, and (we hope) the contribution process isn't very painful.
        [Docs](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer/blob/main/docs/AddingACompiler.md), example PR: [1](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer/pull/6171),[2](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/infra/pull/1241). We'll also be happy to try and help in our [discord](https://discord.gg/r9XASD3q).

        Sometimes there are a lot of versions for any given compiler. Tell us which ones would be a good starting point if this is a new compiler.
        If we already support this compiler, but we have fallen back on our available versions, tell us which ones are missing.
        Note that we might say no to minor versions for some compilers

        URL of where we can find the compiler.
        Ideally, it's also easy to find installation/building instructions there, but if it's not, please also link that.
