        Note: You are welcome to open a request for a library - but you're even more welcome to open a PR for it! Today we rely almost entirely on contributions for compiler/library requests, and (we hope) the contribution process isn't very painful.
        [Docs](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer/blob/main/docs/AddingALibrary.md), example PR: [1](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer/pull/6253),[2](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/infra/pull/1253). We'll also be happy to try and help in our [discord](https://discord.gg/r9XASD3q).

        Is there any specific reason as to why you want this library to be added?

        EXTRA:
        It would be very helpful for the implementator to have some small snippet of code to tell when the library has been properly installed.
        BUT do not feel forced to provide one, this is just a nice-to-have extra!
      placeholder: It's an excellent testing library for testing C++ code
