        Is there any specific reason as to why you want this library to be added?

        EXTRA:
        It would be very helpful for the implementator to have some small snippet of code to tell when the library has been properly installed.
        BUT do not feel forced to provide one, this is just a nice-to-have extra!
      placeholder: It's an excellent testing library for testing C++ code
