Thanks for taking the time to improve CE. We really appreciate it.
  Before opening the PR, please make sure that the tests & linter pass their checks,
  by running `make check`.
  In the best case scenario, you are also adding tests to back up your changes,
  but don't sweat it if you don't. We can discuss them at a later date.
