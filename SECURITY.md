# Security Policy

Compiler Explorer allows remote users to compile and, if configured, execute code. We take security seriously, and
encourage users to promptly report security vulnerabilities they find.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If the issue can be reported without revealing exploitable specifics, please file
[an issue](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer/issues/new/choose) as a bug.

Please email matt@godbolt.org with specifics, or if the bug can't be reported publically without leaving an obvious
exploit in the public eye.

We expect to get back within a day or two. If you don't hear from us, please do ping us again, or reach out to us on the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/wFXUwDp).
