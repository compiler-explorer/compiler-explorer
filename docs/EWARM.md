# Running EWARM compiler on windows host
This document will show a little insight on how to get the IAR ARM compiler working with compiler explorer *(Some line highlighting is broken as EWAVR is different from EWARM)*

# Prerequisites
To run the IAR ARM compiler you will need:

- A valid installation of the IAR ARM compiler. [EWARM](https://www.iar.com/iar-embedded-workbench/#!?architecture=Arm) has a free 30 day trial on their website
- Technically you need a license as well to run the compiler, however you can get by with the 30 day free trial, as you will be able to run the compiler for 30 days for free
- MinGW C++ toolchain for `c++filt` and `objdump`

## IAR ARM Compiler
This compiler will be installed along with the IAR Embedded Workbench (EWARM). Default installation location is under `C:\Program Files (x86)\IAR Systems\Embedded Workbench 8.2\arm\bin\iccarm.exe`

## MinGW C++ Toolchain
We need to install this toolchain through [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), as it contains `c++filt` and `objdump`, which are needed to demangle the assembly

- First download [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
- Install it and run it, entering the first command `pacman -Syuu`, this command will update all the internal MSYS2 modules to their latest version. This command will also update all installed modules, such as the toolchain if it was installed.
- When you run the command for the first time, it will exit the bash console. You have to open it again and run the same command again `pacman -Syuu`
- After the second time, everything will be up to date. To install the MinGW toolchain, run `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain`. This will install the toolchain to your MSYS2 default installation path under `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin`
- Add this path `C:\msys64\mingw64\bin` to windows global `PATH` 
- Test by running `c++filt --help` from windows command prompt, if everything is set up correctly, then you should see all the command line options for c++filt

# Setup and Configuration
## Running compiler explorer on Windows
Refer to the [readme](https://github.com/compiler-explorer/compiler-explorer/blob/master/docs/WindowsNative.md) on running Native on Windows for general setup of Compiler Explorer and other compilers.

## Setting up c++.local.properties
The next step is to create a `c++.local.properties` file under `etc/config` folder. The next step is going to be different for everyone, as you can choose what compiler options you pass to the compiler and so on, but im going to paste my template here and you can just modify, what you need

```

```
**Its important to note that the `compiler.iar8.32.4.compilerType` field is set to `ewarm` this will be the custom compiler key later on**

## Running Compiler Explorer

You should be able to just `cd` into the compiler explorer repository and run `npm start`. After that just head on to [localhost:10240](http://localhost:10240)
