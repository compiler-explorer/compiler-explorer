# Running TI-C2000 compiler

This document is a very basic explanation of how to get the TI-C2000 compiler working with compiler explorer.

# Prerequisites

To run the TI-C2000 compiler you will need a valid installation of the C2000 compiler. https://www.ti.com/tool/C2000-CGT

## Setting up c++.local.properties

The next step is to create a `c++.local.properties` file under `etc/config` folder. The next step is going to be
different for everyone, as you can choose what compiler options you pass to the compiler and so on, but I'm going to
paste my template here, and you can just modify, what you need

```
compilers=&c2000
# TI-C2000 Compilers
group.c2000.compilers=c2k2260LTS
group.c2000.versionFlag=-version
group.c2000.supportsBinary=false
group.c2000.intelAsm=
group.c2000.compilerType=tic2000
group.c2000.demangler=C:\ti\ccs1210\ccs\tools\compiler\ti-cgt-c2000_22.6.0.LTS\bin\dem2000.exe
group.c2000.demanglerType=tic2000
group.c2000.includeFlag=-I

compiler.c2k2260LTS.exe=C:\ti\ccs1210\ccs\tools\compiler\ti-cgt-c2000_22.6.0.LTS\bin\cl2000.exe
compiler.c2k2260LTS.options=-I"C:\ti\ccs1210\ccs\tools\compiler\ti-cgt-c2000_22.6.0.LTS\include"
compiler.c2k2260LTS.name=C2000 22.6.0.LTS
```

## Running Compiler Explorer

You should be able to just `cd` into the compiler explorer repository and run `npm start`. After that just head on to
[localhost:10240](http://localhost:10240)
