See \u201cCalling Procedures Using Call and RET\u201d in Chapter 6 of the <em>Intel\u00ae 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer\u2019s Manual, Volume 1</em>, for additional information on near, far, and inter-privilege-level calls. See Chapter 7, \u201cTask Management,\u201d in the <em>Intel\u00ae 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer\u2019s Manual, Volume 3A</em>, for information on performing task switches with the CALL instruction.</p><p><strong>Near Call.</strong> When executing a near call, the processor pushes the value of the EIP register (which contains the offset of the instruction following the CALL instruction) on the stack (for use later as a return-instruction pointer). The processor then branches to the address in the current code segment specified by the target operand. The target operand specifies either an absolute offset in the code segment (an offset from the base of the code segment) or a relative offset (a signed displacement relative to the current value of the instruction pointer in the EIP register; this value points to the instruction following the CALL instruction). The CS register is not changed on near calls.</p><p>For a near call absolute, an absolute offset is specified indirectly in a general-purpose register or a memory location (<em>r/m16</em>, <em>r/m32, or r/m64</em>). The operand-size attribute determines the size of the target operand (16, 32 or 64 bits). When in 64-bit mode, the operand size for near call (and all near branches) is forced to 64-bits. Absolute offsets are loaded directly into the EIP(RIP) register. If the operand size attribute is 16, the upper two bytes of the EIP register are cleared, resulting in a maximum instruction pointer size of 16 bits. When accessing an absolute offset indirectly using the stack pointer [ESP] as the base register, the base value used is the value of the ESP before the instruction executes.</p>",

The IRETD mnemonic (interrupt return double) is intended for use when returning from an interrupt when using the 32-bit operand size; however, most assemblers use the IRET mnemonic interchangeably for both operand sizes.</p><p>In Real-Address Mode, the IRET instruction performs a far return to the interrupted program or procedure. During this operation, the processor pops the return instruction pointer, return code segment selector, and EFLAGS image from the stack to the EIP, CS, and EFLAGS registers, respectively, and then resumes execution of the interrupted program or procedure.</p><p>In Protected Mode, the action of the IRET instruction depends on the settings of the NT (nested task) and VM flags in the EFLAGS register and the VM flag in the EFLAGS image stored on the current stack. Depending on the setting of these flags, the processor performs the following types of interrupt returns:</p><p>If the NT flag (EFLAGS register) is cleared, the IRET instruction performs a far return from the interrupt procedure, without a task switch. The code segment being returned to must be equally or less privileged than the interrupt handler routine (as indicated by the RPL field of the code segment selector popped from the stack).</p>",

The source operand is a memory location, the address of which is read from either the DS:SI, DS:ESI or the RSI registers (depending on the address-size attribute of the instruction, 16, 32 or 64, respectively). (The DS segment may be overridden with a segment override prefix.) The destination operand is an I/O port address (from 0 to 65,535) that is read from the DX register. The size of the I/O port being accessed (that is, the size of the source and destination operands) is determined by the opcode for an 8-bit I/O port or by the operand-size attribute of the instruction for a 16- or 32-bit I/O port.</p><p>At the assembly-code level, two forms of this instruction are allowed: the \u201cexplicit-operands\u201d form and the \u201cno-operands\u201d form. The explicit-operands form (specified with the OUTS mnemonic) allows the source and destination operands to be specified explicitly. Here, the source operand should be a symbol that indicates the size of the I/O port and the source address, and the destination operand must be DX. This explicit-operands form is provided to allow documentation; however, note that the documentation provided by this form can be misleading. That is, the source operand symbol must specify the correct <strong>type</strong> (size) of the operand (byte, word, or doubleword), but it does not have to specify the correct <strong>location</strong>. The location is always specified by the DS:(E)SI or RSI registers, which must be loaded correctly before the OUTS instruction is executed.</p><p>The no-operands form provides \u201cshort forms\u201d of the byte, word, and doubleword versions of the OUTS instructions. Here also DS:(E)SI is assumed to be the source operand and DX is assumed to be the destination operand. The size of the I/O port is specified with the choice of mnemonic: OUTSB (byte), OUTSW (word), or OUTSD (doubleword).</p><p>After the byte, word, or doubleword is transferred from the memory location to the I/O port, the SI/ESI/RSI register is incremented or decremented automatically according to the setting of the DF flag in the EFLAGS register. (If the DF flag is 0, the (E)SI register is incremented; if the DF flag is 1, the SI/ESI/RSI register is decremented.) The SI/ESI/RSI register is incremented or decremented by 1 for byte operations, by 2 for word operations, and by 4 for doubleword operations.</p><p>The OUTS, OUTSB, OUTSW, and OUTSD instructions can be preceded by the REP prefix for block input of ECX bytes, words, or doublewords. See \u201cREP/REPE/REPZ /REPNE/REPNZ\u2014Repeat String Operation Prefix\u201d in this chapter for a description of the REP prefix. This instruction is only useful for accessing I/O ports located in the processor\u2019s I/O address space. See Chapter 19, \u201cInput/Output,\u201d in the <em>Intel\u00ae 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer\u2019s Manual, Volume 1</em>, for more information on accessing I/O ports in the I/O address space.</p>",

The PAUSE instruction provides a hint to the processor that the code sequence is a spin-wait loop. The processor uses this hint to avoid the memory order violation in most situations, which greatly improves processor performance. For this reason, it is recommended that a PAUSE instruction be placed in all spin-wait loops.</p><p>An additional function of the PAUSE instruction is to reduce the power consumed by a processor while executing a spin loop. A processor can execute a spin-wait loop extremely quickly, causing the processor to consume a lot of power while it waits for the resource it is spinning on to become available. Inserting a pause instruction in a spin-wait loop greatly reduces the processor\u2019s power consumption.</p><p>This instruction was introduced in the Pentium 4 processors, but is backward compatible with all IA-32 processors. In earlier IA-32 processors, the PAUSE instruction operates like a NOP instruction. The Pentium 4 and Intel Xeon processors implement the PAUSE instruction as a delay. The delay is finite and can be zero for some processors. This instruction does not change the architectural state of the processor (that is, it performs essentially a delaying no-op operation).</p><p>This instruction\u2019s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.</p>",
