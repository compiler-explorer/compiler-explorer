<h2>Compiler Explorer Cookie Policy</h2>

<p>
    Browsers support the storing and sending back of small text files called "Cookies". These cookie files can be used
    (amongst other things) to help track the usage of a website. See
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Mozilla
        description of cookies</a> for more details.
</p>

<p>
    Compiler Explorer uses Google Analytics, which in turn uses cookies. Google Analytics allows us to see how many
    individual users of Compiler Explorer there are, how often users visit us, the average amount of time spent on the
    site, the frequency and distribution of compilers selected, and so on. It is invaluable in helping us make
    decisions in prioritising work on the site. It's important to note that these cookies are anonymous: we don't know
    who each individual user is. Our Google Analytics settings prevent data being retained for more than 14 months. The
    cookie stored is a first party cookie: you will find it in your browser under "godbolt.org" cookies.

<p>
    Your privacy is important to us and you may opt out of this tracking at any time using the buttons on this dialog,
    with no loss of access or functionality of Compiler Explorer.
